# POP ART CALCULATOR

## APP SUMMARY

This code creates a visually appealing calculator web application with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The HTML5 structures the calculator interface, including a display and buttons for digits, operators, clear, and equals, while linking to an external stylesheet and script. The JavaScript manages the calculator's functionality, updating the display, handling number and operator inputs, performing calculations, and clearing the display. Additionally, it adds interactive features like a background colour change button, sound effects on button clicks, and a background music toggle. The CSS3 styles the calculator for a clean look, adjusts button appearances on hover, and customizes fonts, making the design responsive for smaller screens.
